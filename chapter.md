# Dagoba: a simple in-memory graph database

_An exploration of connectedness through the heuristic of exposition_

A long time ago, when the world was still young, all data walked in happily single file. To ask a question of your data you merely put a fence in the path, and each datum jumped it in turn. Life was easy and programming was a breeze.

Then came the random access revolution, and data grazed freely across the hillside. Herding data became a serious concern -- if you can access any piece of data at any time, how do you know which one to pick next? Techniques were developed for corralling the data by forming links between items [N] [the network model (CODASYL), the hierarchical model (IMS), etc], marshaling groups of units into formation through their linking assemblage. Questioning data meant picking a sheep and pulling along everything connected to it. 

Later programmers departed from this tradition, imposing a set of rules on how data would be aggregated. [N] [Codd, etc] Rather than tying disparate data directly together they would cluster by content, decomposing data into bite-sized pieces, clustered in kennels and collared with a name tag. 


For much of recorded history this relational model reigned supreme. Its dominance has recently been challenged by growing set of contending schools, including techniques that harken back to the earliest attempts to domesticate random-access data. In theory any question we wish to ask of data trapped in a relational well can be answered, but in practice the effort of properly framing our request and the amount of time required to receive our answer may both be untenable: hence our desire to reposition our data.



The distributed revolution changed everything, again. Data broke free of spacial constraints and roamed from machine to machine. CAP-wielding programmers busted the relational monopoly, opening the door to a new herding techniques -- some of which harkened back to the earliest methods used after data first gained its freedom. We're going to look at one of these, a schema known as a graph database.




## Make it work

Suppose you've been asked to create a booking system for an airline. 

[Toronto to Timbuktu...]


Let's start with a simple question: how many connected components are there in the Lagarias arithmetic derivative of the first N numbers out to k steps?

--- some exposition ---

How should we go about solving such a thing?


### I know, we'll make a graph database!

The dictionary defines "graph database" as a database for graphs. Thanks, dictionary! Let's break that down a little.

A data base is like a fort for data. You can put data in it and get data back out of it.

A graph in this sense is a set of vertices and a set of edges. It's basically a bunch of dots connected by lines. 

So what's the simplest thing we can possibly build that could technically be called a "graph database"? We need a place to put some vertices and edges, and a way to get them back out.

We're in JS, so let's make an array of vertices: 

  vertices = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  
And an array of edges:
  
  edges = [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,1], [3,4], [4,5], [4,6] ]

Notice that we're modeling edges as a pair of vertices. Also notice that those pairs are ordered, because we're using arrays. That means we're modeling a *directed graph*, where every edge has a starting vertex and an ending vertex. [lines have arrows.] Doing it this way adds some complexity to our model because we have to keep track of the direction of edges, but it also allows us to ask more interesting questions, like "which vertices point in to vertex 3?" or "which vertex has the most outgoing edges?". If needed we can model an undirected graph by doubling up our edges array:

  function undirectMe (edges) 
    { return edges.reduce( function(acc, edge)
      { acc.push([ edge[1], edge[0] ]) }, edges.slice() )}

Now we need some way to get information back out. What kinds of questions do we want to ask? We can ask about who our neighbors are:

  function into (node) 
    { return edges.reduce( function(acc, edge) 
      { return (edge[1] === node) ? acc.concat(edge[0]) : acc }, [] )}
  function out (node) 
    { return edges.reduce( function(acc, edge) 
      { return (edge[0] === node) ? acc.concat(edge[1]) : acc }, [] )}
  function neighbors (node) { return into(node).concat(out(node)) }

simpler:
  function matchAndConcat (node, side) 
    { return function (acc, edge) 
      { return (edge[side] === node) ? acc.concat( edge[1-side] ) : acc }}

  function out  (node) { return edges.reduce( matchAndConcat(node, 0) )}
  function into (node) { return edges.reduce( matchAndConcat(node, 1) )}

second neighbors:

  neighbors(4).map(neighbors).reduce(function(acc, nodes) {return acc.concat(nodes)}, [])

wouldn't that be nicer if we could just say 

  neighbors(neighbors(4))
  
sure, we can do that. just make everything take nodes instead of node

what if we want to filter the nodes we visit?

  function filter (nodes, fun) { return nodes.filter(fun) }

This is pretty good, but what if we care about more than just numbers? String labels should work fine. What about objects? 

  alice, bob, charlie, delta
  var nodes = [ alice, bob, charlie, delta ]
  var edges = [ [alice, bob], [bob, charlie], [charlie, delta], [charlie, alice], [bob, delta] ]

  neighbors... path... 

Hey, still works!

This is great, but what if we could use the vertex attributes in our query?

  ask about friends of charlie with blah blahs
  
Fun! But what if we want to ask about all of Alice's employees? Let's add some edge attributes.

  edge -> {_inV: A_id, _outV: B_id, _label: "employed", _id: 123, foo: "bar"}
  
[and of course a way to filter on edges / nodes...]



/// So let's draw a shape: [stick man]. We'll number our vertices so we can keep track of them -- remember that graphs have no inherent "shape", so these graphs are all equivalent.





## Make it right

So we've got a working graph database. It even works for fancy objects and stuff. So we're done, right? 

### Laziness

Suppose we'd like to find a few people who have both tennis and philately as a hobby. We can start from tennis, go out to its hobbyists, out again to their hobbies, back in from philately and then take a few. (change this query)

G.v('tennis').in().as('person').outV('philately').in().matches('person').take(5)

And this works great, until our graph gets large and we run out of memory before Dave Brubeck gets to play. The problem is that we're completing each query segment before passing the data along to the next one, so we end up with an immense amount of data. If there were a way for later segments to pull data from earlier segments instead of having it pushed in to them, that would solve this problem. In other words, we need lazy evaluation. 

Now in some languages that would be trivial, but JavaScript is an eager language, so we're going to have to do a little work. First of all, our query segments can't just return data any more. Instead we're going to need to process each segment on demand. That means we'll need some way of driving this process forward. Here's how we'll do that.

// introduce the driver loop

Now we'll need to modify our query components to work within this new system. This is moderately straightforward:

// new query components

Cool, now we can query without blowing our memory limits and wasting a bunch of cycles on unneeded computation. As a side benefit, we can build a new query component that allows us to progressively take more elements until we get all that we need:

// new pipe thing

We can even resume this after coming back in from an asynchronous event, so we can use external sources to drive our querying. 

// example




/// (this is old, and may get skipped entirely)
/// How do we get laziness in JS? Well, we're using ES6 features, so generators come to mind. That could look like this: []
/// -- good idea, but: can't go backward, can't orthopt, 
/// --> query transformer: id() -> attr('_id')
/// --> then we add label matching for easy edge walking
/// --> then we add object queries for more complicated stuff



### Updates

(maybe lead in from the async stuff above, since that provides the context for concurrency issues.)

There's a problem with our 'out' query component: if someone deletes an edge we've visited while we're in the middle of a query we'll skip a different edge, because our counter is off. We could lock the vertices in our query, but one of the strengths of this approach is driving the iteration through the query space from code, so our query object might be long-lived. Even though we're in a single-threaded event loop, our queries can span multiple asynchronous re-entries, which means concurrency concerns like this are a very real problem. 
So instead we'll slice and pop the edge list each time we reach a new vertex. This burns some extra CPU and pushes more work onto the GC, so we'll stick a note here so we know what to do if this shows up as a hotspot during our profiling.

// new 'out' query component (and friends)

One concern with doing our queries this new way is that we're still not seeing a completely consistent chronology. Skipping random edges, like we did before, leaves us with an entirely inconsistent view of the universe, where things that have always existed may appear to be gone. This is generally undesirable, though many modern systems for storing very large amounts of data have exactly this property. [N] [google, facebook, kayak, etc -- often queries over heavily sharded datasets or multiple apis with pagination or timeouts have this property]

The change we just made means we will always traverse every edge a particular vertex had _at the moment we visited it_. That means as we begin traversing edges we may see new vertices at different points in the graph chronology, and may even see the same vertex at different points in the chronology at different points in our query. Depending on the relationships we're storing this may provide a view of the universe that seemingly defies the laws of physics, even though no laws have actually been broken. 

If we need to see the world as it exists at a particular moment in time (e.g. 'now', where now is the moment our query begins) we can change our driver loop and the update handlers to add versioning to the data, and pass a pointer to that particular version into the query system. Doing this also opens the door to true transactions, and automated rollback/retries in an STM-like fashion. 


/// What happens if someone grabs some data while someone else updates some data? What if two folks update at the same time? 
/// - immutable data (crypto sig of hash of data a la puffs)
///   - weak map for bonus data
///   - immutable lib, query over time

/// If we want to treat the data we receive as immutable we have a couple choices: JSON/clone or hand out references to graph data but clone on change (update-on-write). The later requires we trust our users not to mess with our data, or maybe we can "Freeze" it to keep them from changing it. In ES6 we can use Proxy Objects for this [maybe]. 
/// Even doing this doesn't free us from other concurrency concerns, though: if multiple write come in from different places, what happens? Last write wins? Or do we require a reference to the previous object (Clojure's atoms), otherwise fail / retry (retry case could be like STM). Do we lock nodes that are undergoing a transaction? What is a transaction in this context anyway? [do once/queue/later help here?]



### Hooks

Uniqueness of results vs counting # of results -- both are valid use cases. Can we solve with query component for counting plus hook for uniqueness?

(Maybe merge this section with updating, because half the hooks involve cloning)


### error handling

What if we did a query like this:
> G.v(-23).out([2,3,4]).take('a').foo()

Maybe we should handle those errors a little better.

### tests

- tests for components
- end-to-end tests

### serialization

### persistence

### OO vs FP re GDB wrt Dagoba (extensibility, pipeline management, etc)


## Make it fast

All production graph databases share a very particular performance characteristic: graph traversal queries are constant time with respect to total graph size. [N] [The fancy term for this is "index-free adjacency".] In a non-graph database, asking for the list of someone's friends can require time proportional to the number of entries, because in the naive case you have to look at every entry. The means if a query over ten entries takes a millisecond then a query over ten million entries will take almost two weeks. Your friend list would arrive faster if sent by Pony Express! [N] [Though only in operation for 18 months due to the arrival of the transcontinental telegraph and the outbreak of the American Civil War, the Pony Express is still remembered today for delivering mail coast to coast in just ten days.]

// do a perf test with the O(n) graph

To alleviate this dismal performance most databases index over oft-queried fields, which turns an O(n) search into an O(log n) search. This gives considerably better search time performance, but at the cost of some write performance and a lot of space -- indices can easily double the size of a database. Much of the modern DBA's role lies in carefully balancing these time/space tradeoffs and tediously tending to the index garden, weeding out unneeded indices and adding new ones when necessary. [replace this]

// add an index
// do a perf test with an indexed graph

Graph databases sidestep this issue by making direct connections between vertices and edges, so graph traversals are just pointer jumps: no need to read through everything, no need for indices. Now finding your friends has the same price regardless of total number of people in the graph, with no additional space cost or write time cost. One downside to this approach is that the pointers work best when the whole graph is in memory on the same machine. Sharding a graph across multiple machines is still an active area of research. [N] [point to a couple graph theory papers on NP-completeness of optimal splitting, but also some practical takes on this that mostly work ok]

// add pointers
// perf test
// wow such perform

### Orthogonal Optimization

We've improved our performance for large graphs by several dozen orders of magnitude. That's pretty good, but we can do better. Each step in our query has a fixed cost for building the gremlins and making the function calls, as well as a per-step cost. Because we're splitting each step out into its own separate unit, those per-step costs can be quite high compared to what they could be if we could combine some steps. We've sacrificed performance for code simplicity. 
Many will argue that this sacrifice is acceptable, and that simplicity should trump performance whenever possible, but this is a false dichotomy. We can have our simple, easily understood model and also gain the performance benefits of combining steps -- we just have to beef up our compiler a little. 
How do we do that without sacrificing simplicity? By making the new compilation steps orthogonal to our existing model. We already have a working system, so keep that in place. But let's add some new stepflavours, and some new preprocessors that we can turn on to pull those flavours in to our pipeline. We'll tag the preprocessors so we can turn them all on or off easily. 

// ok build that
// perf test it
// cool it's faster

Great, we're fast! Notice that by deliberately ignoring the chances we had to optimize early and by writing everything in as decomposed and simplistic a way as we possibly could that we've opened up opportunities for global optimizations. [more]

We should probably confirm that our optimizations don't break anything. Maybe we can write a bunch of tests for each of these new pieces, like we did before. 

// write a test or two

This is *really* boring... and error prone. And it doesn't reveal any of the unexpected ways that combinations of optimizations may interact, or how the preprocessor affects that. Ok, new plan: probabilistic testing!
Because we have a working, well-tested pipeline and because we've created our optimizations as an optional, orthogonal pipeline we can now write tests that take advantage of this fact.

// build a random graph
// build a random query
// compare opt and non-opt flavours

We've created a (very specialized) version of quickcheck [N] in 9 lines of code! Now we just let this run for awhile whenever we add new optimizations and it will tell us when they fail.

## Wrapping up

So what have we learned? Graph databases are great for storing interconnected [Z] data that you plan to query via graph traversals. Adding laziness allows for a fluent interface over queries you could never express in an eager system for performance reasons, and allows you to cross async boundaries. Time makes things complicated, and time from multiple perspectives (i.e. concurrency) makes things very complicated, so whenever we can avoid introducing a temporal dependence (e.g. mutable state, measurable effects, etc) we make reasoning about our system easier. Building in a simple, decoupled and painfully unoptimized style leaves the door open for global optimizations later on, and using a driver loop allows for orthogonal optimizations -- each without introducing the brittleness and complexity into our code that is the hallmark of most optimization techniques. 

That last point can't be overstated: keep it simple. Eschew optimization in favor of simplicity. Work hard to achieve simplicity by finding the right model. Explore many possibilities. The chapters in this book provide ample evidence that highly non-trivial applications can have a small, tight kernel. Once you find that kernel for the application you are building, fight to keep complexity from polluting it. Build hooks for attaching additional functionality, and maintain your abstraction barriers at all costs. Using these techniques well is not easy, but they can give you leverage over otherwise intractable problems. 









[Z] Not *too* interconnected, though: if most things are connected to most other things you'll have an edge explosion and may have to find a different way to store those connections.

// TODO: change all node -> vertex   (/sigh)
// can you put the _id in the node/edge? does addNodes return a list of ids or a list of nodes? 
// property graph model

var g = Dagoba.graph()
g.addNodes([ {_id:1, name:"Fred"}, {_id:2, name:"Bob"}, {_id:3, name:"Tom"}, {_id:4, name:"Dick"}, {_id:5, name:"Harry"} ])
g.addEdges([ {_inV: 1, _outV: 2, _label: "father"}, {_inV: 2, _outV: 3, _label: "father"}, {_inV: 2, _outV: 4, _label: "father"}, {_inV: 2, _outV: 5, _label: "father"} ])

g.v(1).out().out('father').name    // TODO: check proxies for this -- can we use them? otherwise...
g.v(1).out().out('father').attr('name')
g.v(1).out().out('father').attr('name').paths()

so each of these g.xxx things is actually just adding elements to a query list, which can be optimized when something calls it and everything happens lazily. how do we do that?


// function incoming (node) { return edges.reduce(function(edge) {if (edge[1] === node) acc.push(edge[0]) }, [])}
// function outgoing (node) { return edges.reduce(function(edge) {if (edge[0] === node) acc.push(edge[1]) }, [])}
// function neighbors (node) { return incoming(node).concat(outgoing(node)) }

//  I have quite a few more features to add and I want a debugger/visualizer/history thing 
//  and I want to convert it all to ES6 but this is where it's at right now.


make it right:

there's a problem here though -- it's really cumbersome to combine these questions. What if we wanted the nearest neighbor with a foo of bar?

use filters to create subgraphs...

a fluent style for creating subgraphs...

modularlize it so you can have multiple graphs and a nice api...

and allow query filters (and later optimizers) to be added at runtime...

updates:
- mutate in place
- remove and re-add
issues: 
- performance (mutate-in-place is a bit faster -- for large updates this probably matters)
- remove and re-add still has to connect to all the old pointers by _id: otherwise the old edges fail
  - also the only (natural) way to add loops and be a full graph
- normal issues with mutate-in-place apply: shared mutable state plus concurrency -> asplode
- but if we hand out references to the real nodes other things can mutate them, even if we don't

so: let's mutate-in-place for perf and simplicity, but never hand out refs to prevent mutation issues. it's a little slower because we have to serialize (or at least deep clone) before we hand over the results, but that part happens in a callback that we can cancel if our application doesn't need it.
